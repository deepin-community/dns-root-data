dns-root-data for Debian
------------------------

 The source files for this package were created by downloading IANA
 DNSSEC root-anchor data from https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/ and
 zone hints from https://www.iana.org/domains/root/files .  Please
 also take a look at get_orig_source in debian/rules.
